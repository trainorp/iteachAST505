    "But when working with formulas like $r = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_i (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum_i (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}$, it is often good to break things down into pieces, take a look at the pieces, and then assemble it all together. That way you are less likely to make a mistake such as misplacing parentheses."
