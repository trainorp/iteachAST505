We don't discuss how to use the HSD procedure by hand, however it is a good procedure (often the best for one-way ANOVA) for you to be able to employ.

    "Arsenic is a heavy metal that is toxic to humans. We are exposed to different heavy metals (including arsenic) in the food that we eat and the water that we drink. Some researchers are interested in whether arsenic exposure differs between racial groups, as there may be different dietary patterns within these groups. For examle, some racial groups may *on average* or typically consume more rice than others (a possible route of having small exposures to arsenic) or more seafood (another possible route of exposure depending on the type of fish and how it was raised). For this next example, let's assume that we are interested in determining whether there is evidence that the population means of urinary arsenic levels differ by ethnicity.\n",

Some of the de-identified datasets are publically availble. For our example we will look at a subset that I made for studying the relationship between urinary arsenic levels and ethnicity. **Caution** NHANES is designed to be used for making national level estimates and hypothesis tests that are valid at the nationwide level. However, to make this nationally representative you have to use a special system of weighting each observation differently. We will not do this for this example *hence* the inferences we make will not generalize to the population of the US. This subset is from the 2015-2016 cycle of this study. The data contains measurements of arsenic that were made from the participant's urine as well as demographic information about the included participants.\n",
