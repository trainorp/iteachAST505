Please notice I have added the \"set.seed(3)\" function before using the \"rnorm\" command.

Using \"set.seed(3)\" means that the random numbers that are generated from the normal distribution will be the same if you run \"set.seed(3)\" and \"rnorm\" together again.

    "The importance of the central limit theorem is that the sampling distribution of statistics that we are interested in (such as the mean, median, variance, or even quartiles) are approximately normal (and this approximation gets better and better as our sample size increases). We can actually apply the central limit theorem for discrete random variables. Below we will work through an example using the Binomial distribution. First let's generate 10,000 random numbers from a Binomial distribution with $n=1000$ and $\\pi = .003$. We will use the \"binom\" function which has the following form \"rbinom(Number of random numbers, $n$, $\\pi$)\". We will save these random numbers as \"a\". "
