This is because using the $t$-distribution in by hand calculations is quite difficult. However, in most cases we need to use $t$-distributions because the population variance is unknown. If we assume the population variance is known, as we have done above, but then we use $t$-test procedures our hypothesis testing will have less power than we would expect for a fixed sample size; equivalently, we would need a larger sample size to acheive the power we wish. While we do not talk about these $t$-test power and sample size calculations in this class they are easy to do uing the *emph* power package in R.\n",
