This has the following form: \"Response variable ~ Group variable\". So for us, this will be \"weight ~ feed\" to examine if there are differences in the population means of chicken weights by feed type. the next argument is \"data\" which tells R which \"data.frame\" contains these two variables. We wrap the \"aov\" function in another function called \"summary\". What this function does is provide us with a nice summary table from the ANOVA $F$-test, showing us SSB, SSW, the mean squares, the $F^*$ test statistic, and the p-value for the test.
