	\begin{itemize}
		\item ``\textbf{\textit{Statistics}} is the science of designing studies or experiments, collecting data, and modeling/analyzing data for the purpose of decision making and scientific discovery when the available information is both limited and variable''

\begin{frame}{Statistics \& The Scientific method}{Formulating research goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item All research starts with a question
	\item[]
	\item Example questions: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Does quitting smoking lead to weight gain?
		\item Is compound X carcinogenic in humans?
		\item Do most voters support candidate X?
	\end{itemize}
	\item[]
	\item Research questions can then be reformulated as \emph{testable} hypotheses
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Quitting smoking is related to weight gain. Quitting smoking is not related to weight gain.
		\item Compound X is related to the presence of cancer in humans (perhaps the development of malignant tumors). Compound X is not related the presence of cancer in humans.
		\item Most voters do not support candidate X. Most voters do support candidate X.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are multiple types of studies (or experiments), which we will discuss in this course
		\item[]
		\item If we want to test the hypothesis that quitting is related to weight gain:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We could survey individuals who quit smoking and ask how much weight they gained / lost during some time period of smoking cessation*
			\item We could review the medical records of individuals enrolled in a medically supervised smoking cessation program and record weight loss / weight gain**
			\item We could expose genetically inbred mice on a fixed diet to smoking vapors for a period, cease the exposure, and record weight loss / weight gain**
		\end{itemize}

	Three critical design attributes we must define when designing a study or an experiment:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Experimental unit (study unit)
		\item[]
		\item Variables of interest
		\item[]
		\item Sampling mechanism \& sample size
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Statistics \& The Scientific method}{Designing a study}
	\vspace{-12pt}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textbf{\emph{experimental unit}} or \textbf{\emph{study unit}} is often natural to the research question 
		\item[]
		\item If we want to test the hypothesis that quitting smoking is related to weight gain it is likely that our \emph{study units} would be individual humans who have recently quit smoking
		\item[]
		\item \textbf{\emph{Variables of interest}} are attributes that may vary from study unit to study unit that we need to measure in order to test a hypothesis
		\item[]
		\item If we want to test the hypothesis that quitting smoking is related to weight gain our \emph{variables of interest} might include: weight loss / gain of each individual human or BMI
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Statistics \& The Scientific method}{Designing a study}
	\vspace{-12pt}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Problem: we are severely limited in how much data we can collect and how many measurements of variables we can make to answer research questions
		\item[]
		\item To test the hypothesis that quitting smoking is related to weight gain, we could survey individuals who quit smoking and ask how much weight they gained / lost during some time period of smoking cessation
		\item[]
		\item Can we survey every person who ever smoked and then quit smoking (past and present?) and record their weight gain / loss after they quit smoking?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}

		\item[]
		\item Can we review every medical record of every individual who participated in a smoking cessation program and record their weight gain or loss?
		\item[]
		\item We must determine what is the ``population'' we are interested in and we must “sample” from it (take a smaller subset)

\begin{frame}{Statistics \& The Scientific method}{Collecting data}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The method of data collection depends on the study design / design of experiment 
		\item[]
		\item Example. To test our hypothesis that smoking cessation is related to weight gain: we could survey individuals who quit smoking and ask how much weight they gained / lost during some time period of smoking cessation
		\item[]
		\item Data collection: Conduct the survey (make phone calls, etc), record the responses
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Statistics \& The Scientific method}{Collecting data}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are many important ethical considerations in the collection of data (how it is collected, how it is stored \& protected)
		\item[]
		\item Even seemingly benign data collection can have ethical implications:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Would you want the world to know that you are in a smoking cessation program?
			\item Would you want the world to know which political candidate you prefer?
			\item Would you want the world to know your telephone number?

\begin{frame}{Statistics \& The Scientific method}{Drawing inferences}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An \textbf{\emph{inference}} is a conclusion about a population that we make from measurements made from the sample
		\item[]
		\item This is the subject of this course! We will learn how we make inferences about a population from measurements we make in a sample
		\item[]
		\item Example inference: From our survey of 500 people who quit smoking (our sample) we find that the average weight change was +3 lbs at two months after having quit smoking. Our inference then is that within the population (all people who quit smoking) people gain about 3 lbs after quitting smoking
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Statistics \& The Scientific method}{Drawing inferences}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A critical aspect of “statistical inference” is conveying the reliability of an inference
		\item[]
		\item If we find that average weight change is +3 lbs from our sample, this value is hopefully close to the average weight change in the population
		\item[]
		\item 	We can use mathematics to determine the reliability of such an inference. We can determine mathematically if this +3 lbs number from the sample is likely to be close to the number for the population
		\item[]
		\item We will discuss measures of reliability soon, however you may recognize some already: 63\% of voters support proposition X with a margin of error of +/- 3\%
